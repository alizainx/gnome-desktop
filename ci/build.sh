# ci/build.sh — turn one recipe directory into .zex file(s).
#
# Usage: ci/build.sh <pkgdir>
#   e.g. ci/build.sh gcc
#
# Identical to userland-recipes' ci/build.sh — the only thing that
# differs between a userland and a syshub package is manifest.toml's
# `_syshub` flag (and install paths), which zex-ports publish already
# routes on. Nothing here needs to know which kind of package it's
# building.
#
# Env this script expects the CI job to set:
#   CHOST            — target triple, e.g. x86_64-zainium-linux-musl
#   REQUIRES_SYSHUB   — value passed to `substrate pack --requires-syshub`
#   SUBSTRATE          — path to the substrate binary (falls back to `substrate` on PATH)
#   PUBLISH           — "1" to also run `zex-ports publish` on each .zex (release
#                        stage only — the check stage leaves this unset, build-only)
#
# On success, the finished .zex file(s) are left in $CI_PROJECT_DIR (repo root),
# one per package/subpackage. Everything under .zexbuild-staging/ is scratch
# space — never declared as a GitLab CI `artifacts:` path, so it's discarded
# with the rest of the job workspace once the job ends.
